  "A grid system is a design tool used to arrange content on a webpage. It is a series of vertical and horizontal lines that create a matrix of intersecting points, which can be used to align and organize page elements. Grid systems are used to create a consistent look and feel across a website, and can help to make the layout more visually appealing and easier to navigate.",
  "If you’ve been to New York City and have walked the streets, it is easy to figure out how to get from one place to another because of the grid system that the city is built on. Just as the predictability of a city grid helps locals and tourists get around easily, so do webpage grids provide a structure that guides users and designers alike. Because of their consistent reference point, grids improve page readability and scannability and allow people to quickly get where they need to go.",

                There are three common grid types used in websites and interfaces: column grid, modular grid, and
                hierarchical grid.
              </p>
              <p>
                Column grid involves dividing a page into vertical columns. UI elements and content are then aligned to
                these columns.
              </p>
              <p>
                Modular grid extends the column grid further by adding rows to it. This intersection of columns and rows
                make up modules to which elements and content are aligned. Modular grids are great for ecommerce and
                listing pages, as rows are repeatable to accommodate browsing.
              </p>
              <p>
                Hierarchical grid: Content is organized by importance using columns, rows, and modules. The most
                important elements and pieces of content take up the biggest pieces of the grid.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div className="space-y-4 text-sm leading-6 text-[#2f3137]">
              <h2 className="text-base font-semibold text-[#111]">Breaking Down the Grid</h2>
              <p>
                Regardless of the type of grid you are using, the grid is made up of three elements: columns, gutters,
                and margins.
              </p>
              <p>
                <span className="font-semibold text-[#111]">Columns:</span> Columns take up most of the real estate in a
                grid. Elements and content are placed in columns. To adapt to any screen size, column widths are
                generally defined with percentages rather than fixed values and the number of columns will vary. For
                example, a grid on a mobile device might have 4 columns and a grid on a desktop might have 12 columns.
              </p>
              <p>
                <span className="font-semibold text-[#111]">Gutters:</span> The gutter is the space between columns that
                separates elements and content from different columns. Gutter widths are fixed values but can change
                based on different breakpoints. For example, wider gutters are appropriate for larger screens, whereas
                smaller gutters are appropriate for smaller screens like mobile.
              </p>

              <p className="font-semibold text-[#111]">Example 1: Hierarchical Grid</p>
              <p>
                Our first example is from The New York Times. This screen utilizes a hierarchical grid to create a
                newspaper-like reading experience. A desktop screen size, two main columns make up the hierarchical
                grid. The most important news story takes up the most space in the grid, the left column, followed by
                secondary and tertiary stories, which take up the smaller column and modules on the right.
              </p>

                alt="Greenhouse workspace"
                width={980}
                height={560}
                className="h-[260px] w-full object-cover md:h-[340px]"
              />
            </motion.div>

            <div className="space-y-4 text-sm leading-6 text-[#2f3137]">
              <p>
                Always place content within columns, not gutters. The gutters should remain empty as you place elements
                on the grid in order to clearly separate and align content and elements.
              </p>
              <p>
                <span className="font-semibold text-[#111]">Consider using an 8px grid system.</span> For most common
                devices, the screen size in pixels is a multiple of 8. Keeping grid-component values at a multiple of 8
                will generally make it easier to scale and implement a grid.
              </p>
              <h2 className="text-base font-semibold text-[#111]">Conclusion</h2>
              <p>
                Grids not only provide designers a structure on which to base layouts, but they also improve readability
                and scannability for end users. Use a good grid system that easily adapts to various screen sizes.
